# Welcome to Fortran Runner for Visual Studio Code!

## Features

The goal of this extension is to provide the user with an easy method to inject launch.json and tasks.json files into their project and run Fortran within Visual Studio Code.

## Operation

Quite simply, open the command palette (CTRL+Shift+P) and select (or enter) "Create Fortran Configuration". From there, head on to the Run & Debug menu and click the play button!

## Requirements

This extension does NOT provide debugging or language syntax capability. Please use another extension in tandem with this, such as "Modern Fortran".
Assumed installation of GCC MinGW Fortran and C++.

## I hope you enjoy this extension! Please let me know of any suggestions or bugs.
